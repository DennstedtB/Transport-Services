# Transport-Services

### This repository is still in development! Do not use it until at least one release is published! 

Those classes should create Transport Requests and add Objects to it. 
Currently working is only the customizing request ( but also only adding objects to it ) 

To see how the classes are working please have a look into the several unit test classes which are called "LTC_HOW_TO_USE"
